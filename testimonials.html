I used to look forward to English class with Miss Sapna because of the atmosphere she created for her students. At times the texts we did, Macbeth, were overwhelming but with her immaculate style of teaching and support, I was able to analyze and understand Shakespeare in the 8th grade. In tandem with the studying, miss made sure that we had moments of celebration through her pizza parties. Ultimately, she made me feel like family and was with me anytime I needed her help for which I&#x27;m truly grateful. Thank you miss Sapna for transforming my dread of English into joyful learning of the language<br></p>

I tutored with her for 3 years, in that duration my English skills were significantly improved, whether it be novel analysis, essays, vocabulary, sentence structure, every element of literature was covered. Needless to say, the academic gain from the lessons with miss Sapna were profound, but at the same time, whilst studying with her -she invoked the joy of literature, making every classic novel an experience, every class was undoubtedly full of jokes and laughs as we all would immerse ourselves in the world of high school English. I’ve had several tutors throughout my experience in high school, but I can say with certainty miss Sapna is absolutely exceptional, with access to her oasis of literary knowledge, every student has an opportunity to thrive in the subject. I now study at Malvern college, an elite boarding school in England, and it could not have been accomplished with Miss Sapna’s help.<br></p>

As an educator, the impact she&#x27;s had on me has been colossal and she&#x27;s the reason I enjoy literary texts. I would highly recommend Miss Sapna, as her take on language and literature helps acknowledge the importance of English in our lives, and I can personally say- I&#x27;ve enjoyed the journey to the fullest.<br></p>

            <p class="testimonial-para">Hare Krishna 🙏🙏🙏<br>I am very happy to shares my experience of learning with Ms. Sapna Shah. Firstly, she is a very lovely, generous and a humble teacher. I learnt from her how to speak, write, pronunciation that should be used in general n reception service. She taught us very politely and with ease.  At our age where we were above 60 she encouraged us to learn. Today when I send text messages for birthdays, marriage anniversaries or death different way, people who know how my English was and now it has changed big time. They appreciate my improvement in English.  Sapna ma’am I feel proud of you that I&#x27;m your student.  This is all because of s.s.r.g n Sankirtan Prji&#x27;s mercy. Thank u very much for love n blessings every day. You also send me messages without fail love u🙏🙇🤗😘🥰🥰🥰<br></p>
